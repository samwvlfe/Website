                                My first plan of action with this entire project is to allign my vision with the overall theme of Homecoming.
                                This year's theme is "110%", descibed <a href="media/theme.pdf" target="_blank">HERE</a> 
                                by Kellan Fenegan, the 2024 Tigerama director and a good freind of mine. Making the design along the lines of 
                                the theme can make or break the float in the judges eyes. 3 years in a row I have been a part of a float that
                                (to me) looked a lot better but we placed second due to theme allignment. I plan to break that streak and take 
                                home first place this year.

                                The underlying theme is Rock and Roll. I figured we make our design based on "Hard Rock Cafe," but changed to 
                                "Howard's Rock Cafe" to make it Clemson oriented. Howards Rock is a massive part of our football program. It sits 
                                at the top of the Hill at our Stadium, and before every home game all the players and coaches run by and rub/tap 
                                it for luck and commemoration to the famous coach. You can find more info <a href="https://clemsontigers.com/howards-rock/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.
                                Using the staple guitar from the Hard Rock logo, I plan to make that the focal point of our float, as it will be 
                                spinning on the Y-axis, displaying different front and back designs.

                                After meeting with my Homecoming team and discussing the art work that was going to be on it, 
                                I went into photoshop and made this mock up. I think it came out pretty good. It features 3 moving parts, 
                                <span style="font-size: 1.5em;">1.</span> The guitar rotating. <span style="font-size: 1.5em;">2.</span> 
                                A circle rotating behind the float with a cutout to show one of the multiple logos
                                the full circle has on it at a time. <span style="font-size: 1.5em;">3.</span> a 'Tiger Rag' record spinning.

                                This is the circle with all of the logos that will be rotating behind the float itself. It has all of the old 
                                logos in order of when they were established. The cutout will allow one logo to be visible at a time.

                                These floats are built from frames that are bolted to telephone poles. This is the form that I sent in that shows 
                                exactly where our poles go to support our design. I was very careful in choosing where the poles go to ensure the 
                                moving parts have somewhere to be bolted to and we have enough room in the middle for the guitar to rotate freely.
