                        During my 12-week summer internship for SpartanNash, I worked as an application developer 
                        to build a dashboard that tracks the progress of the export warehouse. This cross-dock 
                        warehouse is responsible for the shipment of all groceries delivered to overseas commissaries. 
                        The whole process was a learning experience, as I had to learn a ton about supply chain, 
                        logistics, front-end and back-end web technologies. I have gained many skills from this 
                        internship and will continue as an Intern II through my last year of school.

                        As the Homecoming float director for my fraternity, I am in charge of planning, budgeting, 
                        and building our massive floats. There is so much more than what meets the eye when organizing 
                        a project of this scale. It is a five-day event in the middle of campus for the entire school 
                        to see. The best part about the float is our moving parts, which require a team of STEM majors
                        to ensure they work and, most importantly, are safe. We have received second place for the past 
                        three years and the safest float for the last 2. As the returning float director, I aim to 
                        finally take home first place and our third safest float award.

                        One of the most unique projects I have ever worked on was for a pitch competition hosted by the 
                        SPIRO Institute for Entrepreneurship Leadership. My good friend, Carson Scott (pictured), enquired
                        about my help developing his bizarre idea to alleviate snoring. Our research suggested that during 
                        sleep, the brain can be classically conditioned. I built a prototye with an Arduino board, servo 
                        motor, and a sensor to be used in our initial tests. It was exciting to create something that has 
                        the chance to change lives and pitch it to actual investors. We were awarded fourth place and a 
                        research grant to continue research and testing.
